    I think I did a good job complementing the images to the poetry. The poetry is all about 
    living in harmony, with peace and love being it's pillars. The poetry starts with looking upon
    the green fields which I think reflects thinking deeply and with a hopeful heart and I think that a beautiful 
    sunset that shines upon the fields ultimately signifies that a beautiful night is to prosper from it and is to bring 
    a peace of mind. And yellow is a color that I regard to as having a very warm and a omy feeling. I also found
    an image that says peace and love on it which I think very well compliments my image and the poetry in general. So
    overall I think I did a good job, the more intricate judging I leave it upto you. Thankyou for reading till the end:)
